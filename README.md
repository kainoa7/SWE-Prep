# Google SWE L3 Prep â€“ NeetCode 150 Tracker

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository documents my structured preparation for software engineering interviews, particularly for **Google SWE L3 (entry-level)** roles, using the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) problem list as my core roadmap.

The goal is to build deep proficiency in **data structures, algorithms, and systems thinking**, while tracking consistent progress across the most high-impact patterns.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- âœ… Complete all 150 curated LeetCode problems from NeetCode
- âœ… Master problem-solving patterns commonly asked by top tech companies (Google, Meta, Amazon, etc.)
- âœ… Develop clear, readable, and well-structured code
- âœ… Push solutions consistently with timestamps and problem links
- âœ… Be interview-ready for Fall 2025 application season
